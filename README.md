This is a collection of puredata patches for doing live audio stuff

To run: download pd-extended from http://puredata.info/downloads/pd-extended and load up the leapMIDI_xyz.pd patch.

Right now it contains a sample player that lets you screw up audio with various MIDI inputs, with a 3d visualizer. 
It is designed for use with the Leap Motion hand tracking hardware.
